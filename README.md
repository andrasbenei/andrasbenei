- Hi, I’m Andras
- I worked 6 years in finance what I really liked, but I want to try something new now. I started to learn Python some years ago but I only did minor projects on my laptop so far. Now it's time to do bigger projects and to look for a carrier in the field.

You can reach me via email: andras.benei@gmail.com
